# Statistics
A database system library using C++

# History
Statistics database system series was first programmed in 2019. It was a built-in data-processing library at first. But later, it became an independent project. The first version of Statistics was Statistics A1. It was deprecated several months after it came out for having too many faults and greatly depending on Windows platform. Later, Statistics A1 was reconstructed and became Statistics B1, which had fewer features but fewer faults, too. But it was still depending on Windows. In the summer of 2020, Statistics A1 was re-programmed again and nearly all the bugs discovered were fixed. The new version later became Statistics A2, the current version. Statistics A2 no longer depended on Windows, but there were still some issues about it so this led to outcome of Statistics A3. Since not all the changes expected to be made were done yet, the current version of Statistics A3 is still a beta version.
